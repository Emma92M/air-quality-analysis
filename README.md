## Analysis of air quality and pollutants concertation in the UK major cities between 2016 and 2020
Air Quality Index is a combination of a few chemical elements or pollutants. The calculations are based on the concertation average over a specific period. The data is collected on an hourly and daily basis. The daily average of each component concentration level is assessed based on the average of hourly values reported by the local stations (Air Pollution 2020).
The boundaries for the level of each pollutant concentration are a scale from 0 to 500+ assessing the tolerance level and helps to monitor the air quality in the region (What is the Daily Air Quality Index? - Defra, UK, 2020).

Air Quality data has been collected from an open data website called openaq.org. The website collects daily information from the UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs. The data introduces the daily average for each pollutant since 2016 and has the following structure:
### • City Name
### • Longitude and Latitude
### • Date and hour
### • Pollutants
### • AQI (concentration) for each pollutant
